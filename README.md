# Script to compute the FV Error
 
This repo contains an .m file (```magma```) called:

* ```error_computation.m file```, 

The script can be directly executed, and it generates the error for
the FV scheme and all related homomorphic operations.
More specifically, the functions needed to compute the error 
growth after any homomorphic operation.
